###Description

SF-inlinks provides a fast way to identify 301, 302, 404 and 500 links on your website from a Screaming Frog
"all_inlinks" export. SF-inlinks creates 2 actionnable files for each status code. The first file "inlinks" file shows you 
the number of inlinks for each bad link and allows you to identify big spots quickly (e.g. menu, sub-menu). The second file
"from_to" gives you the detail for all the bad links spots to correct the remaining wrong links.

###How to use this script
